          <p>Hi Scryber!,</p>

          <p>
            After reading the intriguing title, you were hoping to jump right
            in. - Oops! Perd√≥n. Kindly allow me to make you smile with a short
            story before we get serious with the topic üôÉ. If you want to get
            right to the point? <a href="#go-on">Get on!</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is Scrybe‚Äôs first blog, and I thought you might be wondering,
            ‚ÄúWhy this topic as a first blog?‚Äù (I know you didn‚Äôt). Well, here‚Äôs
            why, when creating a slogan for Scrybe: All of the slogans I
            shortlisted had the word "insight," and my team teased me about it.
            I did it because I wanted to emphasize how thoroughly detailed the
            outcomes Scrybe will produce for your team will be. Other words
            could describe that, but none were as effective as IN-SIGHT. Like
            John Wooden said, ‚ÄúIt&apos;s the little details that are vital."
            "Little things make big things happen.‚Äù I hope you understand my
            thought process. Hence, the purpose of this essay is to help you
            fully comprehend the importance of the customer and to once again
            rub the word "insight" in the team&apos;s faces. I do hope that my
            story made you smile and that you now agree with me. Let&apos;s now
            discuss customer insight!
          </p>

          <h2>
            Consumer insights are among the business terms that are frequently

          <p>
            Raw data is the basis for all insights. When it comes to consumer
            insights, you are analyzing raw customer data rather than market
            trends or competitors. These open-ended data and often voice, text,
            or video-based are analyzed by more sophisticated software to find
            consumer insights. These data are gathered through;
            <ul>
              <li>Interviews, chats, customer support recaps</li>
              <li>Monitoring website analytics</li>
